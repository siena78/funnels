    <span class="info">Risks inherent in trading through the internet:</span>
Binary options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Contract expires. Because Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes, they allow a simple “Yes or No” approach.
<br><br>
Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount.
<br><br>
Trading in Binary Options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk and can result in the loss of your entire investment. Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons who understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved in such transactions.
<br><br>
You should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for you in light of your financial circumstances and attitude towards risk. You should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless you understand the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If you are in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for you, please seek independent advice from a financial consulting professional, as Centument does not provide such advice.
<br><br>
It is the Client's responsibility, taking into account his personal circumstances and financial resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying for engaging in Binary Options with Centument and our selected brokers and prior to making any individual order.
<br><br>
Where the Client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with the Company or in making any individual order, the Client should seek advice and consultation from an independent Financial Advisor. If the Client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, the Client should not trade at all.
<br><br>
You are advised that the Binary Options offered by our selected brokers are not always traded under the rules of any recognized, designated or regulated exchange.
<br><br>
Consequently, engaging in Binary Option trading may expose you to substantially greater risks than investments which are so traded.
<br><br>
The Client must acknowledge that engaging in Binary Options poses a great risk of incurring losses and the Client must accept that he is willing to undertake this risk.
<br><br>
